[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mru2/nymph.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mru2/nymph) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/mru2/nymph/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/mru2/nymph)


Nymph is a set of libraries which aims to facilitate the extraction of logic into services for Ruby apps.


No readme yet, the interface is still evolving. Please check the [spec](https://github.com/mru2/nymph/blob/master/spec/nymph_spec.rb)

Still TODO : 

 - Autogenerate client mocks from swagger spec
 - Autogenerate service integration tests from swagger spec
 - Make client extend `HTTParty`, to facilitate the creation of custom clients
 - Rails integration (generators, doc middleware)
